# Food Product Data Analysis for Nutrition App

## Project Overview
This project explores a public dataset of food products to develop a scoring system for a nutrition recommendation application. The app evaluates products based on three key metrics: health score, environmental score, and packaging impact. The project involved cleaning and analyzing data, designing scoring methods, and creating insights to assist users in making informed food choices.

## Objectives
- Clean and preprocess food product data to address missing values and inconsistencies.
- Analyze data to derive insights for nutritional, environmental, and packaging scores.
- Implement scoring systems to assess health, ecological, and packaging impacts.
- Demonstrate the feasibility of a nutrition recommendation app with computed scores.

## Tools & Techniques
- **Python Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Data Processing**: Missing value imputation using KNN, statistical analysis, and data normalization.
- **Analysis**:
  - Univariate: Distribution histograms and normality tests.
  - Bivariate: Correlation analysis and scatter plots.
  - Multivariate: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.

## Key Insights
- **Health Score**:
  - Categories like vegetables, rice, and milk have the highest scores.
  - Increased additives and palm oil content reduce the health score.
- **Environmental Score**:
  - Top countries: Poland, Sweden, and France.
  - Environmental score decreases with higher packaging impact and shipping distance.
- **Packaging Score**:
  - Fresh products score higher, while plastic-heavy packaging scores lower.
  - Certifications like FSC and Green Dot are positive indicators.

## Deliverables
- **Jupyter Notebooks**:
  - Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and anomalies.
  - Data Exploration: Statistical and visualization analysis.
- **Presentation**:
  - Summarizes key findings and recommendations.
- **Proposed App**:
  - Scores products on health, environment, and packaging for informed decisions.

## Future Improvements
- Include detailed packaging and shipping data for precise ecological scoring.
- Enhance prediction models with advanced machine learning techniques.
- Expand analysis to integrate consumer feedback for score validation.

## Why This Project?
This project showcases expertise in:
- Data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- Machine learning techniques for imputation and prediction.
- Application of data science to real-world consumer problems.
